 If the system is in a pure state, the entanglement is preserved. If the system is in a mixed state, the entanglement is not preserved.


 The Jaynes-Cummings model is a quantum system that can be used to simulate the dynamics of a classical system. It is a very simple model, but it can be used to understand the dynamics of a wide range of systems.
